# LM317 Calculator

## Description
This little website helps you to calculate a constant voltage source using the LM317.

## How to use
Just start the LM317_Calculator.html with your favourite webbrowser.<br/>
W3CSS and the graphic of the schematic are added, so the website needs no additional file.

## 3rd party
W3CSS is a powerful and free framework for websites. I love it :-)<br/>
